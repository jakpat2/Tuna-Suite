## ✨ Core Technology: The "Magic" of Word-Sync
Our lyric engine mimics a premium karaoke machine, providing precise timing even when source data is limited.

*   **Hybrid Search Logic:** Attempts a perfect match first, then automatically switches to a "Fuzzy" search with a 4-second safety window if the duration is mismatched.
*   **Predictive Weighting Algorithm:** 
    *   **Character Weighting:** Longer words are assigned more display time than shorter ones.
    *   **Punctuation Awareness:** Detects commas and periods, adding subtle pauses to mimic natural speech.
    *   **Density Scaling:** Automatically adjusts based on the "syllables-per-second" to ensure transitions are seamless.

## 🛠️ How to Use

### Option A: Using Pulse Desktop
1. **Download & Install** the latest release of the Pulse Desktop application.
2. Launch Pulse; the internal server will start automatically.
3. Use the **Pulse Hub** within the app to select your preferred overlays and open them directly.

### Option B: Using the Tuna OBS Plugin
1. Install the [Tuna OBS Plugin](https://github.com/univrsal/tuna) and ensure it is running on port `1608`.
2. Create a new **Browser Source** in OBS.
3. Paste the URL of your chosen tool or edition.
4. **Adjusting Sync (Offset):** If lyrics are consistently off, add `?offset=VALUE` to the end of your URL (Default is 1.3).
    * **To delay:** `.../?offset=2.5`
    * **To speed up:** `.../?offset=0.5`

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
**"Waiting for music..." stays on screen?**
*   **If using Pulse:** Ensure the Pulse Desktop app is running.
*   **If using OBS:** Make sure Tuna is running on port `1608`, make sure you have selected the right music source in Tuna. If Tuna is running on the port and you have selected the right music source try opening the overlay URL in your standard web browser. If prompted to "Allow access to applications on your device," click **Allow**. Click the Lock/Tune icon in the browser address bar to ensure Local Network access is permitted. Refresh the Browser Source in OBS.
