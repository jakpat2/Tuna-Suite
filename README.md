## ✨ Core Technology
### The "Magic" of Word-Sync
Our lyric engine feels like a premium karaoke machine, even though most LRCLib data only provides timestamps for the start of each line.

* **Hybrid Search Logic:** Most overlays fail if the song duration is off by even one second. This version tries a perfect match first, then automatically switches to a "Fuzzy" search with a 4-second safety window.
* **Predictive Weighting Algorithm:** Since the overlay only knows when a line starts, it calculates word timing in real-time:
    * **Character Weighting:** Longer words are assigned more "time" than shorter ones.
    * **Punctuation Awareness:** Detects commas and periods, adding subtle pauses to mimic natural speech.
    * **Density Scaling:** Automatically adjusts based on the "syllables-per-second" to ensure the highlight ends exactly when the next line begins.

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Requirements
* Install the [Tuna Plugin](https://github.com/univrsal/tuna) for OBS.
* Ensure Tuna is running on port: `1608`.

### 2. Setup OBS
1. Create a new **Browser Source** in OBS.
2. Use the URL for the specific tool or edition you prefer.

### 🕒 Adjusting Sync (Offset)
If lyrics are consistently off, add `?offset=VALUE` to the end of your URL:
* **To delay:** `.../?offset=2.5`
* **To speed up:** `.../?offset=0.5`
*(Default is 1.3)*

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
**"Waiting for music..." stays on screen?**
1. Open the overlay URL in your standard web browser.
2. If prompted to **"Allow access to applications on your device,"** click **Allow**.
3. If no prompt appears, click the **Lock/Tune icon** in the address bar and ensure **Local Network access** or **Insecure Content** is allowed.
4. Refresh the Browser Source in OBS.
