# Tuna-Lyrics-OBS-Overlay
An unofficial OBS browser overlay which gets music lyrics from LRClib for a OBS plugin named Tuna.

The official overlay that is in the Tuna plugin github repository looks bad, and uses a lyrics database which is hosted by the creator of the Tuna plugin.
The reason i decided to make this overlay is that:
1. The original one looks bad, just a plain text.
2. The database is not the best, so most of the songs i was stuck with no lyrics found screen.

This project was made for my personal use, but i decided that it would be good if i published it so people can use it.
This overlay uses official LRClib api.
There is also a fallback, so when GET fails it fallbacks to Search. Meaning that you will get your lyrics most of the time.

Quick note, this overlay fetches data from Tuna and listens on port 1608.
Ok, thats all. Enjoy!
